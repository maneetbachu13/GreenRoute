# 🌿 GreenRoute: AI-driven Eco-Navigation System

## 🚗 Overview

**GreenRoute** is an AI-powered eco-navigation system designed to promote sustainable travel by minimizing vehicular carbon emissions.  
Unlike conventional navigation apps that prioritize only speed or distance, GreenRoute intelligently suggests routes based on **environmental impact**, considering factors such as **fuel efficiency, road elevation, vehicle type, and traffic congestion**.

The system integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** for emission estimation and **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for selecting the most eco-friendly path.  
By leveraging real-time data from the **Google Maps API**, GreenRoute encourages **eco-conscious travel decisions** and contributes to **smart city and climate action initiatives**.
